## College_Cpp_class

1. add_imaginary_num
- Create a class Complex having members real and imaginary part, and also  perform addition of two complex numbers. (A+Bi) + (C+Di) =(A+C) +(B+D)i  Using friend function. 

2. binary_search
- Write a program to accept the year of graduation from school as an integer value from, the user. 
- Using the Binary Search technique on the sorted array of integers given below. Output the message “Record exists” If the value input is located in the array. If not, output the message “Record does not exist”. {1982, 1987, 1993, 1996. 1999, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010}.

3. bookstore
- Define a class BOOK with the following specifications : Private members of the class BOOK are 
- BOOK NO : integer type 
- BOOK TITLE : 20 characters 
- PRICE : float (price per copy) 
- TOTAL_COST() : A function to calculate the total cost for N number of copies where N is passed to the function as argument. Public members of the class BOOK are 
- INPUT() : function to read BOOK_NO. BOOKTITLE, PRICE PURCHASE() : function to ask the user to input the number of copies to be purchased. It invokes TOTAL_COST()   and prints the total cost to be paid by the user. 

4. const_full_time
- Create a class called 'TIME' that has 
- three integer data members for hours, minutes and seconds - constructor to initialize the object to zero 
- constructor to initialize the object to some constant value - member function to add two TIME objects 
- member function to display time in HH:MM:SS format Write a main function to create two TIME objects, add them and display the result in HH:MM:SS format.

5. const_para_copy
- Create a class UNIT. Take one data member item in code. 
- Create single parameter constructor to initialize the value of item. 
- Also create and define copy constructor. In main(), create an object A of code and initialize it by 100. 
- Now call the copy constructor to create another object B and initialize it by A. Display the corresponding id’s to verify. 

6. const_time
- Create a class Time with member 
- private 
- hour, min 
- Define constructor functions to initialize and assigned values and find out sum of two time objects using

7. overloading_height
- Create a class Height with data member feet and inch, and declare constructor functions to assign and member function to display values. Now compare two Height class Objects using operator overloading. Height H1(5,6), H2(5,8); 
- if(H1>H2) 
- cout<<"H1 is greater than" 
- else 
- cout<<"H2 is greater than" 

8. shape
- Design a class to overload a function polygon() as follows (i) void polygon(int n, char ch) — with one integer argument and one character type argument that draws a filled square of side n using the character stored in ch. 
- (ii) void polygon(int x, int y) — with two integer arguments that draws a filled rectangle of length x and breadth y, using the symbol ‘@’. 
- (iii) void polygon( ) — with no argument that draws a filled an angle shown below. 

9. student_marks
- Define a class Student that has following attributes: Name: allocated dynamically by a character pointer. 
- Roll no: an integer. 
- Marks: a double type array of 5 elements. 
- Percentage: a float 
- Include a constructor that takes values of Name, Rollno and Marks from the user as input. 
- Also include following methods: CalculatePercentage: that adds all 5 elements of array Marks and calculate percentage according to formula Percentage = (Total marks/ 500 )*100 
- and stores result in member variable Percentage. Grade: that calls CalculatePercentage method and displays the grade accordingly.
